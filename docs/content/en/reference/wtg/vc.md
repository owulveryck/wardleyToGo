     This is a description of the value chain object
---

The value chain is created by simple adding dashes (`-`) between two compoents.

The number of dashes reflect the visibility of two components: the more `-` the less visibile are components to one another.

example: 

```
a - b
a -- c
```

means that `b` is nearer to `a` than `c`.

The absolute position on the map is computed by the parser of the language.
